## FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENTS (Required)

### 1. Business Model Profile Document
**Document Description**: A comprehensive overview of your current business structure, revenue streams, and operational reality
**Purpose & Impact**: These prompts make strategic recommendations based on your specific business model type. Without accurate business context, you'll receive generic advice that doesn't match your actual profit drivers or operational constraints.
**Preparation Instructions**:

**CRITICAL: Business Model Classification**
You must accurately identify your primary business model using these specific categories. The prompts provide completely different advice for each model:

- **SERVICE-BASED MODEL**: 1-on-1 coaching, consulting, fractional work (typically under $15K/month)
  - Revenue comes from trading time for money
  - Limited by personal capacity and hours available
  - Growth requires raising prices or increasing efficiency

- **PRODUCT/COURSE MODEL**: Digital courses, templates, info products ($10K-$50K/month)
  - Revenue from selling knowledge/content products
  - Scalable delivery with upfront creation investment
  - Growth depends on funnel optimization and customer acquisition

- **COMMUNITY/MEMBERSHIP MODEL**: Recurring memberships, masterminds (typically $50K+/month)
  - Revenue from ongoing access to community/content
  - Growth through retention and member lifetime value
  - Network effects and member success drive expansion

- **AGENCY/TEAM MODEL**: Done-for-you services with team delivery ($25K+/month)
  - Revenue from team-delivered services to clients
  - Scalable through hiring and systematization
  - Growth limited by team capacity and delivery margins

**Business Model Documentation Requirements**:
- **Primary Model**: Choose ONE category above that represents 60%+ of your revenue
- **Revenue Breakdown**: List all income sources with exact percentages (e.g., 1-on-1 coaching: 60%, digital course: 30%, affiliate: 10%)
- **Monthly Revenue Data**: Include last 6 months of revenue with growth trajectory
- **Primary Offer Details**: Main product/service, typical price point, average customer lifetime value
- **Customer Acquisition**: How you currently get customers and conversion funnel stages
- **Operational Bottlenecks**: Your biggest constraint right now (time, systems, team, etc.)
- **Model Transition Plans**: If transitioning between models, specify current vs. target state with timeline

### 2. Current Process Documentation
**Document Description**: Step-by-step documentation of your core business processes, even if informal
**Purpose & Impact**: The prompts assess process maturity and automation readiness. Without knowing your current workflows, recommendations will be theoretical rather than actionable for your specific situation.
**Preparation Instructions**:
- **Content Creation Process**: From idea to publication, including time investment
- **Client/Customer Delivery**: End-to-end process for your main offering
- **Business Operations**: How you handle admin, finance, customer service
- **Tool Stack**: All software/platforms you currently use
- **Exception Handling**: What happens when processes break down under pressure

### 3. Historical Performance Data
**Document Description**: Concrete data about what has and hasn't worked in your business
**Purpose & Impact**: Enables accurate benchmarking and prevents repeating past mistakes. Critical for the readiness assessment to understand your track record with systematic changes.
**Preparation Instructions**:
- **Previous Automation Attempts**: What tools you tried, specific outcomes, why they failed/succeeded
- **Performance Metrics**: Any data you currently track (even basic revenue/traffic)
- **Content Performance**: Your top-performing content pieces and what made them successful
- **Customer Feedback**: Specific testimonials, complaints, or requests
- **Time Investment Analysis**: How you currently spend your work hours

## ENHANCEMENT MATERIALS (Highly Valuable)

### 4. Competitive Landscape Analysis
**Document Description**: Research on how similar creators in your space operate and what's working for them
**Purpose & Impact**: Provides industry context for benchmarking and helps identify blind spots in your current approach.
**Preparation Instructions**:
- **Direct Competitors**: 3-5 creators with similar models and size
- **Successful Benchmarks**: Creators you aspire to emulate
- **Industry Standards**: Typical pricing, conversion rates, engagement metrics
- **Emerging Trends**: New tools, strategies, or models gaining traction

### 5. Resource Capacity Assessment
**Document Description**: Honest evaluation of your available time, budget, and implementation capacity
**Purpose & Impact**: Ensures recommendations are realistic for your situation and prevents over-ambitious automation plans that fail due to resource constraints.
**Preparation Instructions**:
- **Time Availability**: Weekly hours you can dedicate to implementation
- **Budget Allocation**: Monthly amount available for tools and systems
- **Team Resources**: Any team members or contractors who could help
- **Learning Capacity**: Your comfort level with new tools and processes
- **Change Management**: How well you handle operational changes

### 6. Strategic Goal Documentation
**Document Description**: Clear articulation of your business objectives and how automation supports them
**Purpose & Impact**: Aligns metric selection and automation priorities with your actual business goals rather than generic "best practices."
**Preparation Instructions**:
- **6-Month Goals**: Specific, measurable objectives
- **Growth Challenges**: What's preventing you from reaching the next level
- **Automation Vision**: How you want automation to change your daily operations
- **Success Criteria**: How you'll know if automation is working
- **Risk Tolerance**: What you're willing to experiment with vs. proven approaches

### 7. Customer Journey Mapping
**Document Description**: Detailed flow of how prospects become customers and their experience with your business
**Purpose & Impact**: Essential for identifying the right metrics to track and automation opportunities that enhance rather than disrupt customer experience.

- **Consideration Process**: What influences their buying decision
- **Purchase Experience**: Exact steps from interest to payment
- **Onboarding/Delivery**: How customers get value from your offering
- **Retention/Expansion**: How customers continue or increase their investment

## OPTIONAL ADDITIONS (When Accessible)

**Purpose & Impact**: Enables more sophisticated metric recommendations and automation ROI calculations.
**Preparation Instructions**:
- **Profit Margins**: By product/service line
- **Cash Flow Patterns**: Seasonal variations, payment timing
- **Customer Acquisition Costs**: By channel if known
- **Lifetime Value Analysis**: Customer value over time

### 9. Team and Delegation Documentation
**Document Description**: Information about your team structure and delegation capabilities
**Purpose & Impact**: Affects automation complexity recommendations and implementation approaches.
**Preparation Instructions**:
- **Team Structure**: Roles and responsibilities
- **Delegation Experiences**: What you've successfully handed off
- **Training Capacity**: Ability to onboard others on new systems
- **Communication Preferences**: How your team collaborates

## Implementation Guidelines

### File Organization
- Create a single folder called "Business_Automation_Analysis"
- Use consistent naming: "01_Business_Model_Profile", "02_Process_Documentation", etc.
- Keep documents under 2 pages each for clarity
- Use bullet points rather than paragraphs for easy scanning

### Avoid These Pitfalls
**Never include:**
- Aspirational information (how you want things to work vs. reality)
- Theoretical frameworks without your specific data
- Generic industry advice copied from others
- Sensitive customer information or data that could breach privacy
- Outdated information that doesn't reflect current operations
- **CRITICAL**: Misclassifying your business model - this will result in completely wrong recommendations

**Business Model Classification Errors to Avoid:**
- Don't claim "hybrid model" unless you truly have 40%+ revenue from multiple categories
- Don't choose aspirational model (where you want to be) vs. current reality
- Don't confuse delivery method with business model (e.g., online courses can be service-based if sold 1-on-1)
- Don't use revenue ranges as primary classifier - focus on the fundamental value exchange and scalability constraints

### Validation Method
**Test your preparation by asking:**
1. Could someone else read these documents and understand exactly how your business works?
2. Are all numbers and percentages based on actual data rather than estimates?
3. Do the documents reflect painful truths as well as successes?
4. Would you feel comfortable sharing this level of detail with a high-end consultant?

**Core Insight**: These prompts are designed to provide strategic consultation at the level of a $5,000-$10,000 engagement. The quality of your input documentation directly determines whether you receive transformational strategic guidance or generic advice. **Most critically, accurate business model classification is essential** - choosing the wrong category will result in completely inappropriate recommendations that could harm your business. Invest the time to prepare authentic, specific, data-driven documentation that honestly reflects your current business model reality, not your aspirations.</code></pre>
