## FOUNDATIONAL DOCUMENTS (Required)

### 1. Business Model Profile Document
**Document Description**: A comprehensive overview of your current business structure, revenue streams, and operational reality

### 2. Current Process Documentation

## Implementation Guidelines

### File Organization
- Create a single folder called "Business_Automation_Analysis"
- Use consistent naming: "01_Business_Model_Profile", "02_Process_Documentation", etc.
- Keep documents under 2 pages each for clarity
- Use bullet points rather than paragraphs for easy scanning

### Avoid These Pitfalls
**Never include:**
- Aspirational information (how you want things to work vs. reality)
- Theoretical frameworks without your specific data
- Generic industry advice copied from others
- Sensitive customer information or data that could breach privacy
- Outdated information that doesn't reflect current operations

### Validation Method
**Test your preparation by asking:**
1. Could someone else read these documents and understand exactly how your business works?
2. Are all numbers and percentages based on actual data rather than estimates?
3. Do the documents reflect painful truths as well as successes?
4. Would you feel comfortable sharing this level of detail with a high-end consultant?

**Core Insight**: These prompts are designed to provide strategic consultation at the level of a $5,000-$10,000 engagement. The quality of your input documentation directly determines whether you receive transformational strategic guidance or generic advice. Invest the time to prepare authentic, specific, data-driven documentationâ€”the prompts will reward this preparation with insights that can fundamentally change how you approach your business.
